# Body Weight Planner

A modernized, responsive, and performance-optimized rewrite of the NIH Body Weight Planner. This application allows users to simulate weight loss trajectories and maintenance requirements based on validated metabolic models.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Real-time weight projection based on dietary intake and physical activity.
- **Lifestyle Phases:** Support for complex, multi-phase weight management plans.
- **Activity Estimation:** Advanced MET-based physical activity calculator using the latest 2024 Compendium data.
- **Privacy First:** All data is persisted locally on your device; no information is transmitted to external servers.
- **Data Portability:** Full export of simulation results to CSV format.
